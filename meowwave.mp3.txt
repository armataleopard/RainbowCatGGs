This is a placeholder for the meowwave.mp3 audio file.

In a production environment, you would replace this with an actual MP3 file containing a lo-fi cat-themed background music.

The same applies to the meow sound effect files (meow1.mp3, meow2.mp3, meow3.mp3, meow4.mp3) referenced in the JavaScript code.

To complete the implementation, you would need to:
1. Create or acquire these audio files
2. Place them in the root directory
3. Remove the placeholder code in script.js that's currently using Web Audio API for sounds
